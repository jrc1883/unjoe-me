# Issue Templates That Guide AI Assistants

*Part 4 of the Agent-Ready Development Series*

---

## The Vague Issue Problem

I used to create issues like this:

```
Title: Login broken
Body: Users can't login. Please fix.
```

Then I'd wonder why AI assistants (and teammates) kept asking clarifying questions.

The issue contains almost no actionable information:
- Which users? All of them?
- What happens when they try?
- What should happen?
- When did this start?
- What's the priority?

**Garbage in, garbage out.** If your issues are vague, your AI assistant's attempts to solve them will be too.

---

## Issues as Contracts

Think of an issue as a contract. It specifies:

1. **What** needs to happen
2. **Why** it matters
3. **How** success is measured
4. **Context** needed to understand it

When issues contain this information, AI assistants can:
- Start working immediately without clarification
- Make appropriate decisions about scope
- Know when they're done
- Reference the issue in commits and PRs

---

## The Issue Template System

GitHub supports multiple issue templates. Here's the structure I use:

```
.github/
└── ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
    ├── bug_report.md
    ├── feature_request.md
    ├── technical_debt.md
    ├── documentation.md
    └── config.yml
```

Let's build each one.

---

## Bug Report Template

```markdown
<!-- .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md -->
---
name: Bug Report
about: Report a bug to help us improve
title: '[BUG] '
labels: 'bug, needs-triage'
assignees: ''
---

## Bug Description

<!-- A clear, concise description of the bug -->

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '...'
3. Scroll down to '...'
4. See error

## Expected Behavior

<!-- What should happen? -->

## Actual Behavior

<!-- What actually happens? -->

## Environment

- **Browser/Device**: <!-- e.g., Chrome 120, iPhone 15 -->
- **OS**: <!-- e.g., Windows 11, macOS Sonoma -->
- **App Version**: <!-- e.g., v2.1.0, commit abc123 -->
- **User Role**: <!-- e.g., Admin, Free User, Guest -->

## Error Messages

<!-- Copy paste any error messages, stack traces, or console output -->

```
Paste error here
```

## Screenshots/Videos

<!-- If applicable, add visual evidence -->

## Additional Context

<!-- Any other relevant information -->
- Did this work before? When?
- Does it happen consistently or intermittently?
- Any workarounds found?

## Possible Cause (Optional)

<!-- If you have ideas about what might be causing this -->

---

**Priority Assessment** (for triagers):
- [ ] Blocking production use
- [ ] Affects many users
- [ ] Has workaround
- [ ] Edge case
```

### Why This Template Works

Every field gives the AI (or developer) specific, actionable information:

| Field | What It Tells AI |
|-------|------------------|
| Steps to Reproduce | Exact sequence to recreate the bug |
| Expected vs Actual | What "fixed" looks like |
| Environment | Where to test the fix |
| Error Messages | Likely location of the bug |
| Possible Cause | Starting point for investigation |

---

## Feature Request Template

```markdown
<!-- .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md -->
---
name: Feature Request
about: Suggest a new feature or enhancement
title: '[FEATURE] '
labels: 'enhancement, needs-triage'
assignees: ''
---

## Problem Statement

<!-- What problem does this feature solve? -->
As a [type of user], I want [goal] so that [benefit].

## Proposed Solution

<!-- How should this work? -->

### User Experience

<!-- Describe the user flow -->
1. User navigates to...
2. User clicks...
3. System displays...

### Acceptance Criteria

<!-- Specific, testable criteria -->
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

## Alternatives Considered

<!-- What other approaches were considered? -->

## Technical Considerations

<!-- Any known technical constraints or dependencies? -->
- Requires: <!-- APIs, services, packages -->
- Affected areas: <!-- files, components, systems -->
- Breaking changes: <!-- yes/no, explain -->

## Design Resources (Optional)

<!-- Mockups, wireframes, or design specs -->

## Priority & Scope

**Business Value**: <!-- Low / Medium / High / Critical -->
**Effort Estimate**: <!-- Small / Medium / Large / XL -->
**Target Release**: <!-- e.g., v2.2, Q1 2025 -->

## Related

<!-- Link to related issues, discussions, or docs -->
- Related to #
- Blocks #
- Blocked by #

---

**Implementation Notes** (for developers):
<!-- Technical guidance or suggestions -->
```

### The AI Advantage

When you tell Claude: "Implement the feature in issue #52"

It can immediately understand:
- The user problem being solved
- The expected user experience
- Specific acceptance criteria (definition of done)
- Technical constraints to work within
- Related code and issues to reference

No back-and-forth required.

```

---

## The Configuration File

```yaml
# .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml
blank_issues_enabled: false
contact_links:
  - name: Questions & Discussions
    url: https://github.com/user/repo/discussions
    about: Ask questions and get help from the community
  - name: Security Vulnerabilities
    url: https://github.com/user/repo/security/advisories/new
    about: Report security issues privately
```

Setting `blank_issues_enabled: false` forces users to pick a template—no more vague one-liner issues.

---

## Labels: The Categorization System

Issues need labels for filtering and prioritization:

```yaml
# Suggested label set

# Type
bug           # Something isn't working
enhancement   # New feature or improvement
tech-debt     # Code quality improvement
documentation # Documentation changes
question      # Question needing answer

# Status
needs-triage  # Needs initial assessment
in-progress   # Currently being worked on
blocked       # Waiting on something
ready         # Ready for development

# Priority
priority-critical  # Production down
priority-high      # Major impact
priority-medium    # Normal priority
priority-low       # Nice to have

# Area (customize for your project)
area-auth     # Authentication/authorization
area-api      # API endpoints
area-ui       # User interface
area-db       # Database
area-ci       # CI/CD

# Effort
size-small    # < 2 hours
size-medium   # 2-8 hours
size-large    # 1-3 days
size-xl       # > 3 days
```

### Automating Labels

```yaml
# .github/workflows/label-sync.yml
name: Label Sync

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths: ['.github/labels.yml']

jobs:
  sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: EndBug/label-sync@v2
        with:
          config-file: .github/labels.yml
```

```yaml
# .github/labels.yml
- name: bug
  color: d73a4a
  description: Something isn't working

- name: enhancement
  color: a2eeef
  description: New feature or improvement

- name: priority-critical
  color: ff0000
  description: Production-impacting issue

# ... add all labels
```

## Issue Relationships

Connect issues to build context:

### Linking Issues

```markdown
## Related Issues

- Depends on: #45
- Blocks: #48, #49
- Related to: #42
- Duplicate of: #40
```

### Parent-Child Relationships

```markdown
## Subtasks

This epic breaks down into:
- [ ] #51 - User authentication
- [ ] #52 - Profile management
- [ ] #53 - Settings page
- [ ] #54 - Notification preferences

Parent: #50 (User Account Epic)
```

### Cross-Repository References

```markdown
Related to org/other-repo#123
```

AI assistants can follow these links to build comprehensive understanding.

---

## The Issue Lifecycle

A well-managed issue follows a predictable lifecycle:

```
Created → Triaged → Ready → In Progress → Review → Done

[needs-triage] → [ready] → [in-progress] → [review] → [closed]
```

### Automation with Project Boards

```yaml
# .github/workflows/issue-automation.yml
name: Issue Automation

on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, labeled, closed]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, closed]

jobs:
  add-to-project:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/add-to-project@v0.5.0
        with:
          project-url: https://github.com/users/YOU/projects/1
          github-token: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_TOKEN }}
```

---

## Writing Issues for AI

When you create an issue that an AI will work on, include:

### 1. Clear Success Criteria

```markdown
## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Login form validates email format
- [ ] Error message appears below input field
- [ ] Form doesn't submit until valid
- [ ] Tests cover all validation cases
```

### 2. Explicit Constraints

```markdown
## Constraints
- Do NOT modify the AuthContext
- Use existing validation utilities in src/utils/
- Keep the current styling
- This is a frontend-only change
```

### 3. Reference Points

```markdown
## Reference
- Similar implementation: src/components/SignupForm.tsx
- Validation utilities: src/utils/validation.ts
- Design spec: figma.com/file/xxx
```

### 4. Out of Scope

```markdown
## Out of Scope (Do Not Change)
- Backend validation (handled separately)
- Password strength meter (future issue)
- Remember me functionality (#67)
```

*Issue management is a core capability of [PopKit](https://popkit.dev). The `/popkit:issue` commands let you create, list, and manage issues directly from Claude Code—with automatic template selection and smart labeling based on context. The AI-friendly templates in this article are exactly what PopKit uses under the hood.*
