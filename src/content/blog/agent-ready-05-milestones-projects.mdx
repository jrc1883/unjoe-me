  A modern, minimalist technical diagram showing GitHub Project Board with Milestones and Kanban workflow on a dark navy blue background (#0a0a0b to #1a1a2e gradient).
  
  SPECIFIC GITHUB PROJECT BOARD ELEMENTS:
  TOP - Timeline with Milestones:
  - Horizontal timeline spanning the width
  - Three milestone markers (hexagons) connected by a glowing blue line:
    1. "v1.5" (left) - green checkmark, 100% complete, "Released Dec 2024"
    2. "v2.0" (center) - yellow progress ring showing 65% complete, "Due Mar 2025" - BRIGHTEST GLOW
    3. "v2.1" (right) - gray outline, 0% complete, "Planned May 2025"
  - Each milestone shows issue count: "12/12", "13/20", "0/8"
  
  CENTER - Kanban Board Columns:
  Four vertical columns with rounded rectangle headers:
  
  COLUMN 1 - "Backlog" (gray header):
  - 3 issue cards stacked:
    - "#54 Add pagination" - label: "enhancement"
    - "#58 Fix mobile nav" - label: "bug"
    - "#61 Update docs" - label: "documentation"
  
  COLUMN 2 - "In Progress" (blue header):
  - 2 issue cards:
    - "#47 JWT Authentication" - label: "feature", assignee avatar, connected to v2.0 milestone
    - "#52 Dark mode toggle" - label: "enhancement", assignee avatar
  
  COLUMN 3 - "In Review" (purple header):
  - 2 issue cards with PR icons:
    - "#45 User profile page" - label: "feature", PR #89 linked, 2 reviewer avatars
    - "#50 API rate limiting" - label: "security", PR #91 linked, green checkmarks
  
  COLUMN 4 - "Done" (green header):
  - 3 collapsed issue cards showing completed work
  - Green checkmarks on each
  - Connection lines flowing to "v2.0" milestone
  
  VISUAL DETAILS:
  - Issue cards as rounded rectangles with subtle shadows
  - Label tags as colored pill shapes (blue, red, green, purple)
  - Assignee avatars as small circular icons on cards
  - Milestone badges on relevant cards showing "v2.0" tag
  - Progress indicators: circular progress rings on milestones
  - Drag-and-drop indicators (subtle dots on card left edge)
  - Connection lines (thin, electric blue) from "In Progress" and "Done" cards flowing up to v2.0 milestone
  - Card numbers (#47, #52, etc.) in monospace font
  - Column headers with issue count badges (e.g., "In Progress (2)")
  
  COMPOSITION:
  - Timeline at top spanning full width
  - Kanban columns below in equal-width layout

# Milestones & Project Boards: The Big Picture

*Part 5 of the Agent-Ready Development Series*

---

## The Forest and the Trees

An AI assistant working on issue #47 knows everything about that issue. But does it know:

- What release is this issue targeting?
- How does this feature fit with others being built?
- Are there dependencies that need to be completed first?
- What's the overall goal this issue contributes to?

Without the big picture, AI assistants make locally optimal decisions that might be globally suboptimal. They implement features that conflict with upcoming changes. They optimize code that's scheduled for deletion. They solve problems that are already solved elsewhere.

**Milestones and project boards give AI assistants the context to make smart decisions.**

---

## Milestones: Time-Boxed Goals

A milestone is a deadline with a purpose. It groups related issues toward a common goal.

### Creating Effective Milestones

```
Milestone: v2.0 - User Authentication Overhaul
Due Date: March 15, 2025

Description:
Complete reimplementation of authentication system. Moving from
session-based auth to JWT with refresh tokens. Includes SSO
integration, passwordless login, and 2FA support.

Success Criteria:
- All existing users can still log in
- Session migration completed
- SSO works with Google and Microsoft
- 2FA enrollment available
- No increase in auth-related support tickets

Related Documentation:
- docs/architecture/auth-v2.md
- docs/migration/auth-migration-plan.md
```

### Milestone Hierarchy

```
Q1 2025 Release (Parent)
├── v2.0 - Authentication Overhaul
│   ├── #45 - JWT implementation
│   ├── #46 - Refresh token logic
│   ├── #47 - SSO integration
│   └── #48 - 2FA support
├── v2.1 - Dashboard Redesign
│   ├── #51 - New layout system
│   ├── #52 - Widget framework
│   └── #53 - Data visualization upgrade
└── v2.2 - Performance Improvements
    ├── #61 - Database query optimization
    ├── #62 - Frontend bundle splitting
    └── #63 - CDN configuration
```

### What AI Sees

When Claude works on issue #47 (SSO integration), it understands:

1. This is part of the v2.0 Authentication Overhaul
2. It needs to work with JWT (#45) and refresh tokens (#46)
3. 2FA (#48) will come after and might depend on SSO
4. The deadline is March 15
5. There's architecture documentation to reference

This context shapes implementation decisions.

## The Context Cascade

Here's how high-level organization flows down to individual work:

```
Quarterly Goal: "Reduce user friction in onboarding"
    │
    ├── Milestone: v2.0 - Authentication Overhaul
    │       │
    │       ├── Epic #40: Passwordless Login
    │       │       │
    │       │       ├── Issue #41: Magic link generation
    │       │       ├── Issue #42: Email delivery integration
    │       │       └── Issue #43: Verification flow UI
    │       │
    │       └── Epic #50: SSO Integration
    │               │
    │               ├── Issue #51: OAuth provider setup
    │               └── Issue #52: Account linking logic
    │
    └── Milestone: v2.1 - Onboarding Flow
            │
            └── Epic #60: Guided Setup
                    │
                    ├── Issue #61: Welcome wizard
                    └── Issue #62: Progress indicators
```

Every issue exists within a context of:
- **Why** it matters (quarterly goal)
- **When** it's needed (milestone deadline)
- **What** it's part of (epic)
- **How** it relates to other work (linked issues)

When you organize work into sprints, AI assistants can help prioritize:

### Sprint Planning Session

```
Sprint 3 Planning (Feb 5-19)

Velocity: ~13 story points based on last 2 sprints

Committed Work:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┬────────┐
│ Issue                                   │ Points │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┼────────┤
│ #47 - SSO integration (Microsoft)       │ 5      │
│ #48 - 2FA enrollment UI                 │ 3      │
│ #49 - Session migration script          │ 3      │
│ #63 - CDN configuration                 │ 2      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┴────────┤
                                    Total │ 13     │
                                          └────────┘

Stretch Goals (if time permits):
- #64 - Cache warming strategy (2 pts)
- #65 - Error monitoring setup (2 pts)

Blocked/Deferred:
- #50 - Google SSO (waiting on business approval)
```

AI assistants can now:
- Focus on sprint-committed issues first
- Know which issues are stretch goals
- Understand what's blocked and why
- Avoid working on deferred items

## Milestone Health Tracking

Track milestone progress explicitly:

```markdown
# v2.0 Authentication Overhaul - Status

**Target Date**: March 15, 2025
**Current Date**: February 10, 2025
**Days Remaining**: 33

## Progress

| Epic | Done | Total | Status |
|------|------|-------|--------|
| JWT Implementation | 3 | 3 | ✅ Complete |
| Passwordless Login | 3 | 4 | 🔄 75% |
| SSO Integration | 1 | 3 | 🔄 33% |
| 2FA Support | 0 | 4 | ⏳ Not started |

**Overall**: 7/14 issues (50%)

## Risk Assessment

🟢 JWT: Complete and tested
🟡 Passwordless: On track, needs email templates
🔴 SSO: Blocked on Google approval
🟡 2FA: Not started, needs to begin by Feb 15

## Decisions Needed

- [ ] Proceed without Google SSO if approval delayed?
- [ ] 2FA optional for v2.0, required for v2.1?
```

## Project Board Automation

Automate board updates to reduce manual work:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/project-automation.yml
name: Project Automation

on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, closed, labeled, unlabeled]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, closed, ready_for_review, review_requested]

jobs:
  update-project:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/add-to-project@v0.5.0
        with:
          project-url: https://github.com/users/YOU/projects/1
          github-token: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_TOKEN }}

  move-on-pr:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event.pull_request
    steps:
      - name: Move to Review
        if: github.event.action == 'ready_for_review'
        uses: leonsteinhaeuser/project-beta-automations@v2
        with:
          project_id: 1
          resource_node_id: ${{ github.event.pull_request.node_id }}
          status_value: "Review"

  move-on-close:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event.issue.state == 'closed'
    steps:
      - name: Move to Done
        uses: leonsteinhaeuser/project-beta-automations@v2
        with:
          project_id: 1
          resource_node_id: ${{ github.event.issue.node_id }}
          status_value: "Done"
```

### Auto-assign Priority

```yaml
# .github/workflows/auto-priority.yml
name: Auto Priority

on:
  issues:
    types: [labeled]

jobs:
  set-priority:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: leonsteinhaeuser/project-beta-automations@v2
        if: contains(github.event.label.name, 'priority-critical')
        with:
          project_id: 1
          resource_node_id: ${{ github.event.issue.node_id }}
          priority_value: "Critical"
```

## The Weekly Rhythm

A sustainable development rhythm looks like:

### Monday: Planning
- Review what's in the current sprint
- Triage new issues from the weekend
- Update milestone health status

### Daily: Standups
- What moved yesterday?
- What's moving today?
- What's blocked?

### Friday: Review
- What shipped this week?
- Update project board
- Identify carryover for next week

### Bi-weekly: Retrospective
- What went well?
- What didn't?
- Adjust process

AI assistants benefit from this rhythm because:
- Priorities are clear and current
- Blockers are identified and documented
- Progress is visible and measurable

*Milestone and project management is central to [PopKit](https://popkit.dev). The `/popkit:milestone` command provides health analysis of your milestones, identifying at-risk deadlines and blocked work. Combined with `/popkit:next`, it intelligently recommends what to work on based on priority, dependencies, and deadline pressure.*
