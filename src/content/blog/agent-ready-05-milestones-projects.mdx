# Milestones & Project Boards: The Big Picture

*Part 5 of the Agent-Ready Development Series*

---

## The Forest and the Trees

An AI assistant working on issue #47 knows everything about that issue. But does it know:

- What release is this issue targeting?
- How does this feature fit with others being built?
- Are there dependencies that need to be completed first?
- What's the overall goal this issue contributes to?

Without the big picture, AI assistants make locally optimal decisions that might be globally suboptimal. They implement features that conflict with upcoming changes. They optimize code that's scheduled for deletion. They solve problems that are already solved elsewhere.

**Milestones and project boards give AI assistants the context to make smart decisions.**

## Milestones: Time-Boxed Goals

A milestone is a deadline with a purpose. It groups related issues toward a common goal.

### Creating Effective Milestones

```
Milestone: v2.0 - User Authentication Overhaul
Due Date: March 15, 2025

Description:
Complete reimplementation of authentication system. Moving from
session-based auth to JWT with refresh tokens. Includes SSO
integration, passwordless login, and 2FA support.

Success Criteria:
- All existing users can still log in
- Session migration completed
- SSO works with Google and Microsoft
- 2FA enrollment available
- No increase in auth-related support tickets

Related Documentation:
- docs/architecture/auth-v2.md
- docs/migration/auth-migration-plan.md
```

### Milestone Hierarchy

```
Q1 2025 Release (Parent)
├── v2.0 - Authentication Overhaul
│   ├── #45 - JWT implementation
│   ├── #46 - Refresh token logic
│   ├── #47 - SSO integration
│   └── #48 - 2FA support
├── v2.1 - Dashboard Redesign
│   ├── #51 - New layout system
│   ├── #52 - Widget framework
│   └── #53 - Data visualization upgrade
└── v2.2 - Performance Improvements
    ├── #61 - Database query optimization
    ├── #62 - Frontend bundle splitting
    └── #63 - CDN configuration
```

### What AI Sees

When Claude works on issue #47 (SSO integration), it understands:

1. This is part of the v2.0 Authentication Overhaul
2. It needs to work with JWT (#45) and refresh tokens (#46)
3. 2FA (#48) will come after and might depend on SSO
4. The deadline is March 15
5. There's architecture documentation to reference

This context shapes implementation decisions.

## The Context Cascade

Here's how high-level organization flows down to individual work:

```
Quarterly Goal: "Reduce user friction in onboarding"
    │
    ├── Milestone: v2.0 - Authentication Overhaul
    │       │
    │       ├── Epic #40: Passwordless Login
    │       │       │
    │       │       ├── Issue #41: Magic link generation
    │       │       ├── Issue #42: Email delivery integration
    │       │       └── Issue #43: Verification flow UI
    │       │
    │       └── Epic #50: SSO Integration
    │               │
    │               ├── Issue #51: OAuth provider setup
    │               └── Issue #52: Account linking logic
    │
    └── Milestone: v2.1 - Onboarding Flow
            │
            └── Epic #60: Guided Setup
                    │
                    ├── Issue #61: Welcome wizard
                    └── Issue #62: Progress indicators
```

Every issue exists within a context of:
- **Why** it matters (quarterly goal)
- **When** it's needed (milestone deadline)
- **What** it's part of (epic)
- **How** it relates to other work (linked issues)

## Sprint Planning with AI

When you organize work into sprints, AI assistants can help prioritize:

### Sprint Planning Session

```
Sprint 3 Planning (Feb 5-19)

Velocity: ~13 story points based on last 2 sprints

Committed Work:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┬────────┐
│ Issue                                   │ Points │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┼────────┤
│ #47 - SSO integration (Microsoft)       │ 5      │
│ #48 - 2FA enrollment UI                 │ 3      │
│ #49 - Session migration script          │ 3      │
│ #63 - CDN configuration                 │ 2      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┴────────┤
                                    Total │ 13     │
                                          └────────┘

Stretch Goals (if time permits):
- #64 - Cache warming strategy (2 pts)
- #65 - Error monitoring setup (2 pts)

Blocked/Deferred:
- #50 - Google SSO (waiting on business approval)
```

AI assistants can now:
- Focus on sprint-committed issues first
- Know which issues are stretch goals
- Understand what's blocked and why
- Avoid working on deferred items

## Milestone Health Tracking

Track milestone progress explicitly:

```markdown
# v2.0 Authentication Overhaul - Status

**Target Date**: March 15, 2025
**Current Date**: February 10, 2025
**Days Remaining**: 33

## Progress

| Epic | Done | Total | Status |
|------|------|-------|--------|
| JWT Implementation | 3 | 3 | ✅ Complete |
| Passwordless Login | 3 | 4 | 🔄 75% |
| SSO Integration | 1 | 3 | 🔄 33% |
| 2FA Support | 0 | 4 | ⏳ Not started |

**Overall**: 7/14 issues (50%)

## Risk Assessment

🟢 JWT: Complete and tested
🟡 Passwordless: On track, needs email templates
🔴 SSO: Blocked on Google approval
🟡 2FA: Not started, needs to begin by Feb 15

## Decisions Needed

- [ ] Proceed without Google SSO if approval delayed?
- [ ] 2FA optional for v2.0, required for v2.1?
```

## Project Board Automation

Automate board updates to reduce manual work:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/project-automation.yml
name: Project Automation

on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, closed, labeled, unlabeled]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, closed, ready_for_review, review_requested]

jobs:
  update-project:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/add-to-project@v0.5.0
        with:
          project-url: https://github.com/users/YOU/projects/1
          github-token: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_TOKEN }}

  move-on-pr:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event.pull_request
    steps:
      - name: Move to Review
        if: github.event.action == 'ready_for_review'
        uses: leonsteinhaeuser/project-beta-automations@v2
        with:
          project_id: 1
          resource_node_id: ${{ github.event.pull_request.node_id }}
          status_value: "Review"

  move-on-close:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event.issue.state == 'closed'
    steps:
      - name: Move to Done
        uses: leonsteinhaeuser/project-beta-automations@v2
        with:
          project_id: 1
          resource_node_id: ${{ github.event.issue.node_id }}
          status_value: "Done"
```

### Auto-assign Priority

```yaml
# .github/workflows/auto-priority.yml
name: Auto Priority

on:
  issues:
    types: [labeled]

jobs:
  set-priority:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: leonsteinhaeuser/project-beta-automations@v2
        if: contains(github.event.label.name, 'priority-critical')
        with:
          project_id: 1
          resource_node_id: ${{ github.event.issue.node_id }}
          priority_value: "Critical"
```

## The Weekly Rhythm

A sustainable development rhythm looks like:

### Monday: Planning
- Review what's in the current sprint
- Triage new issues from the weekend
- Update milestone health status

### Daily: Standups
- What moved yesterday?
- What's moving today?
- What's blocked?

### Friday: Review
- What shipped this week?
- Update project board
- Identify carryover for next week

### Bi-weekly: Retrospective
- What went well?
- What didn't?
- Adjust process

AI assistants benefit from this rhythm because:
- Priorities are clear and current
- Blockers are identified and documented
- Progress is visible and measurable

## Coming Next

In Part 6, we'll explore **Documentation as Executable Context**—making your docs do double duty as AI context and human reference, with patterns for documentation that actually gets used.

---

*Milestone and project management is central to [PopKit](https://popkit.dev). The `/popkit:milestone` command provides health analysis of your milestones, identifying at-risk deadlines and blocked work. Combined with `/popkit:next`, it intelligently recommends what to work on based on priority, dependencies, and deadline pressure.*
