After 21 years in the U.S. Navy, retiring as a Senior Chief Petty Officer (E-8) in February 2024, I've had the privilege of leading sailors across every level of the enlisted ranks. Here are the leadership lessons that shaped me.

## Start by Doing the Work

My first leadership role was as a work center supervisor aboard USS TARAWA. I was responsible for 2 Low Pressure Air Compressors and 10 Deballast Air Compressors. The lesson was simple: you can't lead what you don't understand.

When a Marotta valve failed on our LP Air system, I didn't delegate the troubleshooting. I grabbed wrenches and got my hands dirty. That repair saved the Navy over $30,000 in parts and labor, but more importantly, it showed my team that I'd never ask them to do something I wouldn't do myself.

## Systems Beat Heroics

As I moved into senior leadership roles, I learned that sustainable success comes from systems, not individual heroics. When I became Command Training Department Assistant for 119 sailors, I created a qualification tracking system that:

- Increased mission readiness by 30%
- Was adopted by the gaining command for 329+ sailors
- Reduced administrative burden on junior sailors

The system worked whether I was present or not. That's real leadership.

## Develop People, Not Just Skills

During my time as a Recruit Division Commander at RTC Great Lakes, I trained over 900 recruits. The easy path was focusing on immediate skills, getting them through boot camp. The harder, more important work was developing character.

I learned that my role wasn't to create sailors who needed me. It was to create sailors who would surpass me.

## Numbers Tell Stories

Every evaluation I received emphasized measurable impact:

- Transferred 2.2 million gallons of fuel during RIMPAC 2010
- Ranked #1 of 17 first class petty officers
- Led 14-sailor rig team for 14 multi-national ships
- Managed $50-60M in facility budgets as SEL

Leaders who can't quantify their impact are guessing at their effectiveness.

## The Senior Enlisted Academy Lesson

Earning the Capstone Award at the Navy Senior Enlisted Academy wasn't about being the smartest person in the room. It was about synthesis: taking diverse perspectives and integrating them into coherent strategy.

That skill, seeing how pieces connect, serves me as much in product management as it did in the Navy.

## Looking Forward

These lessons translate directly to my current work at Mars and my aspirations in product management:

- **Start by doing the work** = Deep dive into user problems before proposing solutions
- **Systems beat heroics** = Build repeatable processes, not one-off fixes
- **Develop people** = Invest in team growth, not just deliverables
- **Numbers tell stories** = Measure what matters, but remember metrics serve strategy

Twenty-one years of service taught me that leadership isn't a destination. It's a continuous practice.
