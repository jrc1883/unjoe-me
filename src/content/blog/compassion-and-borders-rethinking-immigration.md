A friend posted something on Facebook that stopped me mid-scroll.

It was a Christmas-themed image connecting the story of Mary and Joseph—finding no room at the inn—to modern refugees and migrants denied entry at borders. The caption quoted a Jesuit priest: *"Christ is present in every migrant and refugee. Can we make room for Him?"*

The implication was clear: if you support border security or immigration enforcement, you're essentially slamming the door on Jesus.

I sat with that for a moment. It's emotionally powerful. The imagery works. And yet... something felt off.

## The Instinct to Argue (and the Better Instinct to Think)

My first impulse was to fire off a response. *That's not what the nativity story means. Joseph and Mary weren't refugees, they were traveling for a census. This is manipulative.*

But I've learned that knee-jerk reactions rarely lead to clarity. So instead, I did something different: I sat down and actually thought through the issue systematically.

What does Scripture actually teach about immigration? About compassion for the vulnerable? About governmental authority? Are those things in tension, or can they coexist?

What followed was one of the most intellectually stimulating theological discussions I've had in months—right there in a Facebook comment thread with a thoughtful friend who pushed back hard on my initial response.

Here's what I learned.

##The Case for Compassion

My friend made strong points. He argued (rightly) that:

1. **Every person has infinite dignity** as created in God's image
2. **The Bible consistently calls God's people to welcome strangers** (Leviticus 19:33-34, Matthew 25:35, Hebrews 13:2)
3. **Many migrants are desperate, not criminals**—fleeing violence, persecution, or grinding poverty
4. **The Flight to Egypt shows that even the Holy Family experienced refugee vulnerability**

All of this is true. And it's central to Christian ethics, not peripheral.

The challenge came when he wrote this: *"The question isn't just 'Is this legal?' but 'Is this loving? Is this just?'"*

And later: *"I don't think Jesus would be asking, 'Are they legal?' but rather, 'Are they hurting? Are they vulnerable? How can I help?'"*

That's when I realized we were talking past each other. We agreed on Christian values—human dignity, compassion, hospitality. But we disagreed on something deeper: **what those values require of governments**.

## The Category Error

Here's where I think the debate gets muddled.

My friend was conflating two distinct categories:
1. **Personal Christian duty** (what I'm called to do as a follower of Christ)
2. **Governmental authority** (what governments are ordained by God to do)

These aren't the same thing.

When I, as a Christian, encounter an immigrant—documented or not—I'm called to show hospitality, offer help, and treat them with dignity. No question. That's Matthew 25. That's Hebrews 13:2. That's the heart of Christian ethics.

But when a government enforces immigration law, it's operating in a different sphere entirely. Romans 13:1-4 describes governments as bearing "the sword"—as agents of order who punish wrongdoing and protect citizens.

What's virtuous for me personally (turning the other cheek, going the extra mile, showing unlimited mercy) would be dereliction of duty for a government that's supposed to maintain order and enforce laws.

**A government that operates like a church ceases to be a government.**

## The Theological Anarchism Problem

The conversation took a fascinating turn when my friend made this argument:

*"Government doesn't exist except as a concept. There are only actions of people. Since 2/3 of government workers are Christian and 80% of immigrants are Christian, any immigration enforcement is really just Christians interacting with Christians. And Jesus said we'll be known by how we love one another."*

I had to stop and admire the rhetorical move here. It's sophisticated. It sounds compassionate. And it completely dissolves the category of governmental authority.

But think about where this logic leads:

- A Christian police officer couldn't arrest a Christian criminal (that's not loving your brother)
- A Christian judge couldn't sentence a Christian defendant (where's the mercy?)
- A Christian soldier couldn't fight against a Christian enemy (can't harm your brother in Christ)

If government is "just a concept" and all that matters is Christian-to-Christian interaction, you've just eliminated the possibility of law enforcement, criminal justice, and national defense.

**This isn't theology. It's anarchism dressed up as brotherly love.**

Romans 13 explicitly treats government as a real institution with divine authority—not just a collection of individual Christians making personal choices. When a border agent enforces the law, they're not acting as "Bob the Christian." They're acting as an agent of governmental authority fulfilling a God-ordained role.

Those are different spheres. Different ethics apply.

## The Compassion-Order Paradox

Here's what I came to realize through this discussion: **compassion and order are not enemies.**

We can—and must—hold both:

**Governments should:**
- Secure borders and enforce immigration laws (Romans 13)
- Process asylum claims efficiently and fairly
- Treat detainees humanely with due process
- Distinguish between refugees fleeing persecution and economic migrants

**Christians should:**
- Show personal hospitality to immigrants
- Advocate for just and humane policies
- Oppose genuine cruelty or abuse in enforcement
- Support ministries serving refugees and asylum seekers

These aren't contradictory. They're complementary.

The mistake is thinking that because I show compassion personally, I must therefore oppose all border enforcement. Or that because I support lawful immigration, I must be uncompassionate.

False choice.

## The Questions That Matter

If I could distill this whole debate down to a few practical questions, it would be these:

1. **Do nations have the right to limit who enters?** If yes, how do they enforce that without being called "uncompassionate"?

2. **How do we distinguish between refugees fleeing persecution and economic migrants seeking opportunities?** Should poverty alone justify entry?

3. **What about citizens' interests?** How do we balance compassion for migrants with responsibility to low-income citizens who compete for jobs, housing, and social services?

4. **If desperate poverty justifies illegal entry, what immigration law can ever be enforced?**

These aren't rhetorical gotchas. They're real trade-offs that policymakers have to navigate. And slogans—whether "build the wall" or "no human is illegal"—don't help us think through them.

## What I Learned

This Facebook debate taught me something important about political thinking:

**The loudest voices offer the simplest answers. The wisest voices ask the hardest questions.**

It's easy to pick a side and signal your tribal affiliation. It's harder to acknowledge competing values and wrestle with real-world trade-offs.

I came away from this conversation with:
- **Greater respect** for my friend's heart for the vulnerable
- **Greater clarity** on the distinction between personal ethics and governmental authority
- **Greater humility** about the complexity of policy questions

And a reminder that sometimes the best response to a Facebook post isn't a quick comment—it's a long, hard think about what you actually believe and why.

## A Closing Thought

I don't know where you land on immigration policy. You might think I'm too harsh on compassion or too soft on enforcement. That's fine.

What I do know is this: if your political framework can't distinguish between what *you* should do and what *governments* should do, you're going to end up confused.

And if you think every policy disagreement is a test of Christian orthodoxy—that enforcing immigration law equals rejecting Christ—you're going to alienate a lot of people who actually share your values but think the application is more complex.

The real world is messy. People are complicated. Governments have competing responsibilities.

And Facebook arguments—when taken seriously—can actually help us think more clearly.

Who knew?

*This essay reflects my personal wrestling with a complex issue. I'm a follower of Christ shaped by Reformed theology, 21 years of military service, and a career in engineering and operations. I believe in human dignity, compassionate immigration policy, and the rule of law. If that sounds like a contradiction, maybe the problem isn't the beliefs—it's the assumption that they can't coexist.*
