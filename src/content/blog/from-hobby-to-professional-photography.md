It started with a camera that didn't cost much. Not a phone camera—this was back when that distinction mattered. A point-and-shoot digital camera with features I didn't understand and a resolution that would be laughable today.

I just wanted to capture moments from deployments. Pictures of the ship, of crew, of ports we visited. Nothing particularly artistic—just documentation.

That hobby turned into something I didn't expect: actual paying work.

## The Equipment Evolution

When I first got serious about photography, I made every beginner's mistake:

I bought the expensive gear before I understood the fundamentals.

A Canon DSLR body, a few decent lenses, lighting equipment. I spent money thinking gear would somehow translate to good photography. It doesn't work that way.

Expensive equipment makes it easier to take good photos. It doesn't make you capable of taking them.

What I eventually learned:

- **The camera body is the least important part**: A decent mirrorless or DSLR from 5 years ago is still perfectly capable
- **Lenses matter more than bodies**: One exceptional lens is better than three mediocre ones
- **Lighting is everything**: You can make a phone camera look professional with good lighting
- **Your eye matters most**: Composition, subject selection, and timing are what separate good photos from lucky ones

I built my kit over years:
- Primary lens: 35mm (the "normal" lens that roughly matches human vision)
- Zoom lens: 24-70mm for flexibility
- Prime lens: 85mm for portraits
- Backup body: Because redundancy matters when you're getting paid
- Lighting: Modifiers, diffusers, reflectors for controlled environments

But more important than any of it was learning to see light.

## Seeing vs. Looking

Photography fundamentally changed how I see the world.

Most people look at scenes. Photographers see light.

When I walk into a room, I'm not just seeing the furniture. I'm seeing how light enters through the window, where shadows fall, how the light reflects off different surfaces, what happens if I move the subject a few feet to the left.

It's an exhausting way to see the world sometimes. You can't just enjoy a sunset—you're analyzing the color temperature, thinking about how to expose for the clouds without blowing out the sky, wondering if you have the right lens.

But it makes you present. Deeply, intensely present in a way that normal life rarely requires.

## The Professional Work

Photography work came in phases:

**Phase 1: Friends and Family**
- Charging money felt weird
- Underpricing absurdly
- Learning what people actually want vs. what I thought looked good

**Phase 2: Event Photography**
- Weddings, corporate events, military ceremonies
- Learning to work under pressure and tight timelines
- Understanding that the client's vision matters more than artistic preference

**Phase 3: Niche Work**
- Specialized photography for specific industries
- Building a portfolio in areas where I had expertise
- Realizing that understanding your subject matter is as important as understanding photography

**Phase 4: Stepping Back**
- Eventually prioritizing other career paths
- Realizing photography was passion work, not primary work
- Understanding when to keep something as a craft rather than a profession

## What Photography Taught Me

Beyond the technical skills and eventual client work, photography taught me principles that apply everywhere:

### Composition Matters
In photography, you're composing a frame. In product design, you're composing an interface. In writing, you're composing an argument. The principles are similar: balance, emphasis, leading the eye, removing distractions.

### Light Creates Understanding
You can photograph the same subject under different lighting and get completely different stories. This taught me that context and framing shape how people perceive anything—a product, an idea, a situation.

### Failure is Data
I've taken thousands of mediocre photos. Each one taught me something about exposure, focus, timing, or composition. Professional photography is built on the foundation of failed experiments.

### Your Unique Perspective Has Value
The thing that worried me most as a photographer was "my style isn't unique." I'd look at photographers I admired and think I'd never achieve that.

Then I realized: my unique perspective comes from my unique experience. A photographer with a Navy background sees subjects differently than one without. My technical background shapes how I approach problems.

You don't find your style by imitating others. You find it by being authentic about what you see and how you see it.

## Bringing It Together

Photography is one thread in a larger tapestry. It's not my primary career, but it's shaped how I see problems and approach solutions in everything I do.

The maker mindset applies to photography just like it applies to home automation or naval engineering: start with curiosity, build the skills through repetition, embrace the craft, and understand that the tools serve your vision—not the other way around.

I still have the expensive gear. I still use it occasionally. But I've learned that the most important tool is knowing how to see.

The camera is just there to record it.
