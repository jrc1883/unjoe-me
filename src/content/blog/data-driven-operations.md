When I transitioned from Process Engineer to MEGA Regional Project Manager at Mars in 2019, the scope of my work expanded from a single facility to dozens of sites across North America and Latin America. The key to managing that scale wasn't working harder. It was building better systems for visibility.

## The Problem: Opacity at Scale

Managing MRO (Maintenance, Repair, and Operations) supply across multiple manufacturing sites creates a visibility problem. Each site has its own:

- Vendor relationships
- SAP configurations
- Compliance patterns
- Performance gaps

Without systematic visibility, you're flying blind. Issues hide until they become crises.

## The Solution: Dashboard Everything

My approach was to build transparency through dashboards:

**Vendor Compliance Heatmaps**
- Color-coded site-by-site vendor performance
- Weekly tracking calls with preferred vendors
- Segment governance team visibility

**Power BI Efficiency Dashboards**
- Real-time efficiency and losses tracking
- SAE (Site Availability Efficiency) monitoring
- Automated data pulls from SAP

**Ariba Reporting Tools**
- Commercial data analysis
- Spend tracking against savings strategies
- Contract category mapping

## The Results

This data-driven approach delivered measurable outcomes:

| Metric | Before | After | Impact |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| SAE | 74.6% | 84.8% | +14% efficiency |
| Waste Rate | 4.6% | 1.9% | -59% reduction |
| PCC | $2,853/ton | $2,575/ton | -10% cost |

**Financial Impact:**
- $815,000 Value Leadership Savings (2018)
- $200,000 annual material waste savings

## The Technical Lift

Getting to this point required deep technical work:

1. **SAP Classification Mapping**: Learning how items are classified in SAP to map across contracted categories. This wasn't glamorous work, but it was essential.

2. **Inventory Calculator Automation**: I developed approximately 50% of a solution to automate the SAP data pull for inventory calculations. Reducing manual work meant more time for analysis.

3. **Data Lake Integration**: Working with the data sprint subteam to bring live data into dashboards, replacing constant manual SAP reports.

4. **Network Troubleshooting**: When SAP scripting went down across the network, I found the solution and rolled it out to the entire maintenance diagnostics team.

## Lessons for Product Management

This experience directly informs my perspective on product management:

**Build for Visibility**: Users don't just need features; they need to see what's happening. Dashboards aren't nice-to-have; they're core product.

**Data Quality is Product Quality**: The best analytics are worthless if the underlying data is messy. Invest in data hygiene.

**Automate the Boring Parts**: Every hour spent on manual data pulls is an hour not spent on analysis and decision-making.

**Measure What Matters**: SAE, PCC, waste rate: these aren't arbitrary metrics. They directly tie to business outcomes.

## The Cross-Functional Challenge

The hardest part wasn't the technical work. It was getting alignment across functions:

- Finance needed different views than operations
- Site leads had different priorities than segment governance
- Vendors required different cadences than internal teams

Building dashboards that served multiple audiences while maintaining a single source of truth was the real product management challenge.

## Looking Forward

Whether it's MRO supply chain analytics or an AI-powered agentic platform, the principles are the same: build visibility, automate the tedious, measure what matters, and serve multiple stakeholders with coherent systems.

That's what I'm looking to bring to my next role.
