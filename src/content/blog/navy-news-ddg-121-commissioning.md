The USS Lenah Sutcliffe Higbee (DDG-121) was commissioned in 2023, continuing the Navy's Arleigh Burke-class destroyer program. To most people, it's a news item. To me, it's a reminder of systems I once kept running.

I never served on a DDG—I was a damage controlman on an amphibious assault ship—but I spent enough time around naval engineers to understand what's actually happening when a new destroyer enters the fleet.

## What the Media Misses

News coverage of ship commissioning usually focuses on the ceremony, the sponsor, the dignitaries. These are important traditions, but they miss what actually matters: this is a $2 billion platform with systems that have to work perfectly because lives depend on them.

The Arleigh Burke-class has been in production since 1989. DDG-121 is a Flight III variant, which means significant updates to combat systems, radar, and engineering plant control systems.

But here's what hasn't changed: the fundamental engineering challenges that kept me awake on watch in the engine room.

## Propulsion Systems and Reliability

The Arleigh Burke-class uses two LM2500 gas turbines and two diesel generators—a combined gas and gas (COGAG) system. These are powerful, efficient, and they've proven reliable for 30+ years.

But "proven reliable" doesn't mean problem-free. Gas turbines require:

- **Precise fuel quality**: Contaminated fuel destroys turbine blades
- **Monitoring and management**: Constant oversight of inlet temperatures, compressor pressures, and turbine speeds
- **Maintenance discipline**: Preventive maintenance actually matters when you're at sea

I spent countless hours ensuring the fuel transferred to the ship was clean. One particulate, one drop of water in the wrong place, and you're talking potential turbine damage.

DDG-121 has better monitoring systems than the ships I served on. Automated diagnostics. Better integration between engineering and combat systems.

But it still comes down to watchstanders doing the work correctly.

## The Generational Handoff

Here's what concerns me: the Navy is commissioning advanced ships faster than it's training sailors to operate them effectively.

When I qualified as an engineer, I spent years learning the systems. Watching senior sailors, standing watches, studying schematics until 2 AM because I wanted to understand how everything connected.

Today's sailors often arrive on a modern destroyer with fancy automation and less hands-on mechanical knowledge than previous generations. The automation is helpful—it's genuinely good engineering. But it can create a skills gap.

If something goes wrong with the automated system, how many sailors understand the underlying mechanical principles well enough to troubleshoot it?

## What I'd Change

If I were consulting on DDG-121's operational readiness:

**1. Prioritize Mechanical Foundation**
- Regardless of how fancy the systems are, sailors need to understand the underlying machinery
- Automation is a tool, not a replacement for understanding

**2. Cross-Train Continuously**
- Don't let sailors become so specialized that they only understand their own system
- The best engineers understand how everything connects

**3. Invest in Maintenance Culture**
- Preventive maintenance is less sexy than new systems but infinitely more important
- A well-maintained ten-year-old destroyer beats a neglected new one

**4. Realistic Readiness Standards**
- It takes time to properly qualify sailors on modern ships
- Pushing them through faster to meet manning requirements undermines safety

## The Personal Connection

I'll never stand watch on DDG-121. My Navy days are behind me. But watching new ships commission still feels personal.

Those systems exist because people like me spent decades learning how to operate them safely. The sailors boarding DDG-121 are inheriting equipment designed and tested by generations of naval engineers and watchstanders.

They have better tools than we did. Better diagnostics, better automation, better monitoring systems.

But they also have greater complexity and less margin for error.

It's a fair trade. Mostly.

## The Larger Question

These ship commissioning announcements always spark the same debate: is the Navy spending enough? Too much? Are we building the right platforms?

From an engineering perspective, the answer is yes—DDG-121 is a sophisticated platform with capabilities well beyond what older destroyers could do.

But sophistication and readiness aren't the same thing.

I hope the sailors boarding that ship get proper time to learn their engineering plant. I hope the Navy invests in training. I hope they take seriously the responsibility of keeping that propulsion plant running at sea.

Because when you're two weeks from port and something goes wrong, no amount of automation will save you. Only people who actually understand the systems.

The USS Lenah Sutcliffe Higbee is a modern marvel of naval engineering. I hope her crew treats her propulsion plant with the respect it deserves.
